Cowboy Bebop is the best anime ever for me, without a doubt. It has magnificent soundtrack, excellent story-line and marvelous blues atmosphere. I have watched it 8 or 9 times, I know it by heart. But I'm ready to return to it again and again. Seriously, I can say many many good things about this anime, but if you have never seen it - just watch it.
Here is Spike Spiegel. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly <3

This artwork is the first one with recorded painting process, soo speedpaint will be available soon on my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO3I5S1lU4W1sWMRzub01Aw).
Also, I have question for you: do I need to post tools and time that I've spent to each artwork?
