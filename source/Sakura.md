My first artwork that I have made in Rebelle. And my message to all, who still on quarantine these days <3
Also, here is speedpaint for this artwork.
![Sakura]()

<!-- more -->
These days we all feel some stress. Huge or little but it is. So I've painted this peaceful artwork to make your day a bit more soft. Take a cup of tea, sit in the cozy place at your home and allow yourself take some relax. You deserve it. We all deserve it.

Be kind to yourself, stay safe and keep calm.

Hugs to all :3
