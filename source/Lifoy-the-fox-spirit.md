I'm glad to present you my OC :3 Her name is Líføy.

![Lifoy]()
<!-- more -->
She is a fox spirit, like Kitsune, but more similar to Fylgja in North mythology, cause she has bounded to her world (like original Fylgja bounded to family) to protect it. But one time she wanted to take a journey with her sister Sôwili (literally not, because spirits don't have family like humans, but that's most accurate definition of their relationships) and to do that, she needs to born in physical foxgirl form. Since that time she has traveled through universe to feed her curiosity and help everyone who needs it on her way. But sometimes, she has to take care of the world under her (not only her, in this case, she's a part of a team of spirits) protection. But in physical form it may be more difficult than she thought.

She likes: tea, rain, look at the stars, cooking, play games (any games literally), sleep.

She doesn't like: make plans, math, big slugs.
