I've fell in love with EVE: Online in 2009 year. Since this time I'm playing this game (with breaks ofc). I owe EVE a lot of funny moments, tons of positive and good vibe. Also I found new friends there <3

I love this game so so much and I still playing it with my gf :3
So, I decided to draw a girl of Servant Sisters of EVE cos their ships are beautiful and their ideology isn't bad :)

**Info, tools and items I've used:**

Krita;
Wacom Intuos pro L;
20+ hours;
Carbon Based Lifeforms tracks <3;
Bunch of different tea. And a LOT OF coffee >.<
