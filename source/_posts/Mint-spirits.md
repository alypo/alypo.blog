Why mint? Cause... i love mint so much :P And i love to play around "humanisation" idea, in this case "spiritisation" xD
Also, my watercolor-like style need improvements and I'm still explore, actually.

**Info, tools and items i used:**

* Paintstorm Studio;
* Wacom Intuos Pro L;
* One hour;
* Three cups of black tea with mint andÂ blackcurrant leaves :3
* Alicks tracks (My friend gave me that music yesterday and I have found it awesome \0/).
