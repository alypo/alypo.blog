I wanted to draw pixel-style art long time ago. And now, with my new galaxy note I have time to do it. Because now I can draw anywhere: in bed, in transport, in toliet, finally xD
Aaaand i have found this experience awesome. There is no constant pain:"How I can do this better?" No. only relax, fun and exploration in colour world. I think it is beginning of new journey for me.
Let's see how it will go on.
