That is my favorite anime past few years.

I love nature, I love camping so much. In my childhood every year me and my parents was going camping at river or in forest. Today we trying to going to nature every year too, but  in a more comfortable way (but I keep dreaming to going camping with tents next year haha). So Yuru Camp reminds me how beautiful and cozy may be days when you don't mind all your problems and just relaxing at nature.
