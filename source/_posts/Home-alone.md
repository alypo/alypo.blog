Last 3 days I have stayed alone at home. After a half-year with my girlfriend i feel so lonely :/ But there are no reasons for deep sadness. We will meet again after 2 weeks. One more bad thing: i got a flu :( For now - I am spending all time on painting and trying to get well.

Also, i have found nice TV series: "agents of S.H.I.E.L.D". Yep, it isn't new, but I'm not a TV addict, so.. anyway, Phil Coulson is amazing :3 may be some time later I will paint artwork about S.H.I.E.L.D team. If you have any ideas like: "Hmmm, what about a nice meeting at the shawarma after battle, like in post title scene in Avengers" - you are welcome in comments :3
