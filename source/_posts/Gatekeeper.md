He's currently name is MrP, but I'm not sure that would be final version. Another variant, that i have in my mind: The scarecrow. But this name sounds like a cliche.

A little backstory:
He's a keeper, i.e. gatekeeper at the gate between the worlds of dreams. He's not good,and not evil, he have got his own goals. 
Technically - MrP is a spirit. He haven't got physical body and he live in dreams (like Ole Luk√∏je) but can use things as avatar (he more often use scarecrow for this). I think he is very powerful spirit, but he don't like to interfere in the affairs of peoples or other spirits and creatures. He's a watcher and a wanderer. No one knows where and how he was born, but as gatekeeper he guard other worlds for a very, very long time.

A big post about him will be on my Patreon page next month.
