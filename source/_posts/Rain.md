I love rain and I love such a bit melancholic vibes. Here is my OC (her name under construction now). She lives in a world that combines tech (space travel, androids, VR, etc) and sorta magic. Like in shadowrun universe, but different way. Honestly, I need to write plot ASAP, cos I'm really exited for this universe and my plans about it. I've revieved my old writings and now I have almost ready concept for my new world :3
